# Box-Shooter-Unity-3D
A first person box shooter game developed in unity 3d
Box shooter is a traditional First Person Shooter game created with Unity objects and particle system effects alone. 

The idea of game is simply to shoot green boxes for time and points, with bonus boxes to add more time and enemy boxes which lead to a loss in time.

During the making of this project, many key concepts such as object pooling, UI design etc. were learnt.
